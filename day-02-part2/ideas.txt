Read input
Store as initial state called `memory`

A position is called an `address`

`Instructions` are comprised of four inputs: `opcode` first, then three `parameters`
Instruction `99` has only an opcode, no parameters

Address of current instruction is the `instruction pointer` (starts at 0). Value increases by the number of values in the instruction (4, or 1 for an opcode of 99)

Determine the pair of inputs that produce an output of 19690720

Address 1 is the 'noun', address 2 is the 'verb'. They will both lie between 0 and 99.
